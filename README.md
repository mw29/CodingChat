# CodingChat
A VR computer science classroom!

***README.txt***
*** PLEASE LOOK AT THE PDF FILE AS WELL FOR MORE IN DEPTH INFORMATION OF OUR IDEAS ***

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
We created a virtual reality classroom. This would be one of six portals that make up a program ultimately called Coding Chat. Three portals are classrooms teaching a programming language (Java, Python, C++), one portal for seminars/speakers, one for a help desk with tutors, and another for a virtual cafe chatroom. We have many ideas of features these portals have the potential to have. Ultimately, we would want this program to be free (funded by sponsors, etc), with only the technology needed of cost to the user.

PREREQUISITES:
Need:
	Unity
	Keyboard or Tap technology 
	PDF reader
	VR headset
	Sensors
    
INSTALLING:
	1. Click on the CodingChat.unitypackage (in GitHub) to download
	2. Open in Unity
	3. Using headset, run program:
	4. Movement is locomotive-physically moving will move user in program

PROJECT INFO:

PORTALS:
	1. Lessons: classrooms where programming languages are taught
		Virtual Teacher to assess user's learning speed
		24/7
	2. Cafe (portal where users can socialize)
		24/7
	3. Help Desk: tutors to help users in their learning proccess
	4. Sessions: guest speakers to discuss any STEM subject.
		Google Expedition tours of company
		Different time zones
		
BENEFITS:
	1. Those with disabilities can code using brainwaves
	2. Hold the attention span of children better
	3. VR can help users with phobias (social anxiety, PTSD, etc.)
	
UNDERREPRESENTATION:
	Major factors in challenges: Commitment, Identity
	Commitment:
	1. 24/7 lessons, help desk, and regional seminars
	2. Free program to user: sponsored by companies (guest speakers)
		Only cost to user would be the technology to use the program (VR headset, keyboard/Tap/MindMaze, etc.):
			-As technology progresses, VR technology cost going down
	Identity:
	1. Avatars help unconscious bias as no one knows your race, age, sexual orientation, or able-bodiedness
		-Though you can choose to enter a cafe with people who identity like you, whatever that may be.
	2. Seminar Speakers/Virtual Teacher representation
		-Invite diverse speakers to speak on their experience, talk of many different topics
		-Virtual Teacher's appearance can be altered (so someone that looks like the user can make them more comfortable)

CLASSROOM FEATURES:
	Have: 
	Locomotion
	Future:
	Interaction with Computer
	Interaction with Virtual Teacher
	Interaction with Input (keyboard, Tap, MindMaze(brainwaves)
	Corkboard:
		future opportunities, seminars, challenges, and more
